Roo is a simple, curly-brace language that compiles to Javascript. Roo combines
the scripting benefits of a dynamically typed language with a readable syntax that is inspired
by Java and Swift.

I co-developed Roo with a team at Loyola Marymount University.
It is written in Coffeescript and compiles into Javascript.
