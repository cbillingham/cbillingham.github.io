Grapevine is an iOS and Android application that automatically populates a user's calendar
with events from Twitter and Facebook feeds they follow. Events are extracted by natural language processing
that intelligently deciphers events from post content.

I co-developed grapevine with a team of talented peers at Loyola Marymount University.
I worked on the Node.js server and event-extraction processor. I programmed the tag-classifier, which
seperates our events into categories through a supervised machine-learning text classifier.
