Arda is a primitive operating system I started writing for fun.
It is based on [littleosbook](http://littleosbook.github.io) and [James Malloy's OS tutorial](http://web.archive.org/web/20101019051118/http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html).

It is developed in C and x86 Assembly on Ubuntu. It uses Bochs to simulate hardware.
