In a discussion with my graphics professor about learning more graphics programming, I remember he 
challenged me to take a look at porting Nate Robin's famous OpenGL tutors to WebGL so they could 
have an easily accessible, permanent place on the web. The tutors teach core graphics concepts in an intuitive, 
visual way. The results would be two-fold:

- He could use the new WebGL tutors to teach core graphics concepts to his class and many others could 
  learn from them online as well.
- Not only would I get more practice in WebGL, but I would also start getting experience in OpenGL.

Our undergraduate computer graphics class was taught in WebGL and while many of the foundational concepts 
are the same, the world of computer graphics is still dominated by OpenGL and C/C++. 
Therefore, in order to improve my knowledge and programming skills, I am going to start working on projects in OpenGL and C++. 
Starting this month, I will be taking a C++ graphics class online as a introduction. Nate Robin's suddenly 
popped back into my head and I thought it would be a great first project to get familiar with OpenGL.

I found some great repositories with Nate Robin's tutors ([I used this one](https://github.com/emanueles/opengl/tree/master/tutors)).
And after compiling without any problems I can finally see why these are so awesome!

There are 7 tutors total. Each teaches a different concept in graphics through visual renders and easy 
interactive numbers. I especially think the lightposition and projection tutors are extremely helpful. 
I found the idea of camera frustum, orthographic vs. perspective projection a difficult theory to grasp when I started. 
And it especially helps to have an interactive visual reference.

So here goes nothing. I'm excited to jump into OpenGL and hopefully this will provide a nice introduction for 
future projects that I'd like to do including a ray-tracer and particle simulation. 
I'll be posting updates on my progress on my blog and 
I'll put up a link to the public repository when I get started.
