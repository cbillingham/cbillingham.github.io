In a discussion with my graphics professor about the learning more graphics programming, I remember he 
challenged me to take a look at porting Nate Robin's famous OpenGL tutors to WebGL so they could 
have an easily accessible, permanent place on the web. The tutors teach core graphics concepts in an intuitive, 
visual way. The results would be two-fold:

- He could use the new WebGL tutors to teach core graphics concepts to his class and many others could 
  learn from them online as well.
- Not only would I get more practice in WebGL, but I would also start getting experience in OpenGL.
